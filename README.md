# Ersatz

> adjective
> (of a product) made or used as a substitute, typically an INFERIOR one, for something else.

Creates a stub API server using a simple configuration file you provide.

# Installation

```
go get github.com/peteclark-ft/ersatz
```

# Usage

## Version 1.0.0 fixtures

First create a `ersatz-fixtures.yml` file (see full example file [here](./_examples/example.yml)), to stub specific API calls. By default, `ersatz` expects your fixtures file to be in the `_ft` folder at the root of your project.

For example, to stub an `/__health` API call, you can use the following configuration:

```
version: 1.0.0 # the ersatz fixtures version. Releases will be backwards compatible
fixtures:
   /__health: # the path of the stub
      get: # the http method
         status: 200 # the response status code to use
         headers: # a map of http response headers to values
            content-type: application/json
         body: # the body of the response - this will be serialised to match the content-type (if provided, otherwise json is the default)
            id: health-check
            ok: false
```

Similarly, to stub a `/__gtg` API call:

```
/__gtg:
   get:
      status: 200
      headers:
         content-type: plain/text; charset=US-ASCII
      body: OK # supports plaintext responses
```

Once you have created your file, start `ersatz` with:

```
ersatz
```

You can optionally specify a port and fixtures file to use:

```
ersatz -p 8080 -f ./_ft/ersatz-fixtures.yml
```

## Version 2.0.0 fixtures
For more complex use cases, you can use `version: 2.0.0` in your fixtures file.

**Specify multiple use cases for the same path-method pair**


For specifying multiple use cases for the same path-method pair you should use something like this:
```
/expect:
    put: # this is an array of resources and not just a resource
    - status: 400
      headers:
        x-returned-header: returned
      expectations:
      - queryParams:
          expect: value1
          expect-2: value2
    - status: 200
      headers:
        x-returned-header: returned
      expectations:
        queryParams:
          expect: value1
```
Keep in mind that for making this work as expected, the order of the use cases matters. The next use case is used only if the expectations are not satisfied. If all resources are skipped because of their expectations, a `501 Not Implemented` will be returned.

**Add more complex `expectations` conditions**

```
/expect:
    put: # this is an array of resources and not just a resource
    - status: 400
      headers:
        x-returned-header: returned
      expectations:
      - queryParams:
          expect: ${miss}
          expect-2: value-for-expect2
        headers:
          Content-Type: ${exists}
```

`${miss}` - check if the query parameter or header is missing
`${exists}` - check if the query parameter or header exists, but does not check it for a specific value.



# CircleCI Usage

The recommended way to run `ersatz` and `dredd` via CircleCI is to use the `ersatz` Docker container. This prevents `ersatz` conflicting with your project's dependencies. First, add the following `dredd` hook script to your project, and reference it in your `dredd.yml`:

```
var hooks = require('hooks');
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');

hooks.beforeAll(function(t, done) {
   var contents = fs.readFileSync('./_ft/ersatz-fixtures.yml', 'utf8');

   var options = {
      host: 'localhost',
      port: '9000',
      path: '/__configure',
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/x-yaml'
      }
   };

   var req = http.request(options, function(res) {
      res.setEncoding('utf8');
   });

   req.write(contents);
   req.end();
   done();
});
```

Then configure your dredd build to run ersatz in a secondary container (make sure you change the following config to use appropriate docker container versions for your app):

```
dredd:
    working_directory: /go/src/github.com/Financial-Times/draft-content-api
    docker:
      - image: bankrs/golang-dredd:gox.x.x-dreddx.x.x
        environment:
          GOPATH: /go
          ...
      - image: peteclark-ft/ersatz:stable
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: External Dependencies
          command: |
            go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor
      - run:
          name: Govendor Sync
          command: govendor sync -v
      - run:
          name: Go Build
          command: go build -v
      - run:
          name: Dredd API Testing
          command: dredd
```

# Docker Image versions

The following ersatz docker versions are supported:

* `latest` - is the latest commit to master
* `stable` - is the latest full release tag in Github
* `x.x.x` - specific tag versions (see [Releases](./releases) for more information)

# More Configuration Examples

Here is an example REST configuration for a `/{uuid}`, supporting `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE`:

```
/85be197c-4fda-407b-8ae3-28bd81978616: # IMPORTANT: Paths must match exactly, as ersatz doesn't do anything clever with them. In this case, all other uuids will 404.
   get:
      status: 200
      body:
         content:
            title: Example Title
   put:
      status: 201
      body:
         message: Created ok
   delete:
      status: 204
```

Example redirect configuration to google.com:

```
/redirect-me:
   get:
      status: 301
      headers:
         Location: http://www.google.com
```

Example endpoint with expected `headers` and `queryParams`. Ersatz will respond with a `501 Unimplemented` to requests that do no match the configured expectations, which __should__ cause your sandbox tests to fail.

```
/expect:
   put:
      status: 200
      headers:
        x-returned-header: returned
      expectations:
        headers:
          x-expected-header: expected
        queryParams:
          param-name: expected-this-too
```

Ersatz also supports multiple expectations provided in an array; at least one expectation must much each request for the simulation to proceed, otherwise, it will return a `501 Unimplemented`.

```
/expect:
  put:
    status: 200
      headers:
        x-returned-header: returned
    expectations:
      - headers:
          x-expected-header: expected
      - queryParams:
          param-name: expected-this-too
```

# Why is Ersatz Useful?

* It's useful for local developer testing - you'd no longer need to point your local machine to real services in a test cluster.
* `ersatz-fixtures.yml` files can be committed along with the codebase, so new developers can re-use your stubs to get up and running quickly.
* We can use it to simulate complex dependencies in CircleCI, allowing us to more easily test our OpenAPI files using DreddJS

# Road Map

* Support OpenAPI for more accurate stubs
* Comparisons between fixtures and the real API it is mocking
